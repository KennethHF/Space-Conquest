Resources []:
 Population [P] - 5k (local to planet)
 Foods [F] - 1U feeds 1k (local to planet) acts more like a "supply depot" for population cap
 Goods [G] - Economy
 Light Materials [L] - Industry (buildings)
 Heavy Materials [H] - Industry (ships building)
 Isotopes [I] - Ships building
 Fuels [U] - Ships maintenace
 

Planet types range on a sliding scale

# <- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -> #
[U]   [I]           [H]      [L]     [G]      [F]      [P]

Gas - Radioactive - Toxic - Barren - Rocky - Organic - Vegetative


Their position on the scale determines % of available resource.
For example, Toxic aligns with [H], therefore is most abundant
in that resource (at 100% output).  Moving left to right from [H], the abundance
decreases.

Modifiers {} range from -10 to 10 (float values).
They are randomly generated when the planet is created and applied directly to
the base stat (example: -4.3 modifier to 100% base stat = 95.7% output)

 MODIFIERS:

 {T} TROPOSPHERE - Effects [P]
 {B} BIOSPHERE - Effects [F]
 {E} ENVIRONMENT - Effects [G]
 {G} GEOLOGY - Effects [L]
 {C} TECTONICS - Effects [H]
 {A} ALBEDO - Effects [I]
 {S} STRATOSPHERE - Effects [U]

Structures () are built on a planet by the owner.  They can be upgraded twice, allowing
for 3 levels (LI initial build, LII upgrade once, LIII upgrade twice).  Levels have the values: +1, +3, +6.  
Except for AUTO categories, all buildings can be built as many times as desired, up until the planet max 
limit is reached. 

Max Limit {M} of structures per planet should be one of these random numbers: 6, 9, 12, 15, 18.

Structures fall into the following categories:

AUTO - Always exists on all planets (1 only) as soon as planet is controlled by
player.  These structures do not count against {M}:

 (C) COLONY - Generates [P], can be upgraded - ([F]5U) LII-([F]7U) LIII-([F]10U)
 (X) STATION - Provides small planetary defense, can be upgraded

EXTRACTORS - Responsible for pulling the resources from the planet at the % of the above stats.

 (F) FARM - Gathers [F]
 (E) EXCHANGE - Gathers [G]
 (M) MINE - Gathers [L]
 (T) FACTORY - Gathers [H]
 (P) PLANT - Gathers [I]
 (H) HARVESTER - Gathers [U]

IMPROVEMENTS increase the modifiers.

 (R) TERRAFORMER - Increases {T}
 (D) BIODOME - Increases {B}
 (Y) RECYLER - Increases {E}
 (B) "Planetary" STABILIZERS - Increases {G}
 (I) "Fault" INHIBITORS- Increases {C}
 (U) "Solar" DISTRIBUTORS - Increases {A}
 (N) "Atmospheric" CONDENSERS - Increases {S}

CONSTRUCTORS can be clicked on to allow other actions such as building ships, crew, or research
+1 progress per tick (LI), +3(LII), +6(LIII)

 (L) LABORATORY - Allows researches
 (A) ACADEMY - Allows training of crew
 (O) STARPORT - Allows building of ships

EXTRA structures provide unique bonuses
 
 (X1) TURRET - Increases damage against an attacker of the planet
 (X2) SHIELD - Increases defense against an attacker of the planet
 (X3) SENSORS - Increases intel of incoming fleets, nearby planets
